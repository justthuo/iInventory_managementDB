Inventory Management System

Description

The Inventory Management System is a MySQL-based application designed to help warehouses and retail stores keep track of products, suppliers, customers, orders, and stock levels across multiple locations. It provides a clear relational schema that ensures data integrity and supports common operations such as:

Adding, updating, and deleting products, suppliers, and customers.

Creating and processing customer orders with detailed line items.

Managing stock levels in different warehouses.

Enforcing relational constraints to prevent invalid data entries.
